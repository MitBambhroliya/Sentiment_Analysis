# Sentiment_Analysis
This project analyzes the sentiment of Reddit comments collected in February 2025 using two models: BERT, a deep learning-based transformer model, and Naive Bayes, a classical machine learning approach. The data was scraped from various subreddits to capture diverse opinions.  After preprocessing the text (tokenization, cleaning, etc.), the dataset was labeled for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). BERT was fine-tuned on this data, while Naive Bayes used TF-IDF features for classification. Model performance was compared using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  The project highlights the effectiveness of modern NLP models like BERT over traditional methods for real-world, user-generated content.
